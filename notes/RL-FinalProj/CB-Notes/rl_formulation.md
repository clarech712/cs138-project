###   RL Integration with Feature Transformation
[Back to Index](../index.md)
**Objective:** To integrate reinforcement learning (RL) into the job recommendation system, leveraging the preprocessed feature representations to learn an optimal recommendation policy.

**1.  Contextual Bandit Formulation**

* **Rationale:**
    * We model the job recommendation problem as a contextual bandit problem, drawing inspiration from the LinUCB paper (Li 2010), to balance exploration and exploitation in a personalized setting.
    * This framework allows the system to learn from user feedback and adapt its recommendations over time.
* **Key Components:**
    * **Context (cₜ):**
        * Representation: The transformed feature vector of the user.
        * Content:
            * User profile information (skills, experience, preferences).
            * User's resume encoding.
            * History of previously recommended jobs (a short-term memory).
            * Potentially, other contextual information (time of day, location, etc.).
        * Processing:
            * The same feature transformation process (projection, optional clustering) is applied to the user's resume and profile data to create a context vector that is comparable to the job description representations.
    * **Action (aₜ):**
        * Representation: The transformed feature vector of a job posting.
        * Content:
            * Encoded job description (See section 5.2.2 in LinUCB paper), including hard skills, soft skills, and requirements.
        * Action Space (A): The set of all available job postings at time t.
    * **Reward (rₜ):**
        * Source: User feedback on the recommended job.
        * Types:
            * Explicit Feedback:
                * Click on job posting (+1).
                * Save job (+2).
                * Apply for job (+3).
                * Express disinterest (-1).
            * Implicit Feedback:
                * Time spent viewing job description (+0.1 per 10 seconds).
        * Scaling:
            * Rewards can be scaled or combined to prioritize certain user actions.
    * **Policy (π):**
        * Representation: A function (e.g., a neural network) that maps the context vector (cₜ) to a probability distribution over the available job actions (aₜ).
        * Goal: To learn a policy that maximizes the expected cumulative reward.

**2.  RL Algorithm**

* **Algorithm Selection:**
    * Explore contextual bandit algorithms suitable for high-dimensional feature spaces:
        * LinUCB (Linear Upper Confidence Bound) (Li 2010): Efficient and well-motivated from learning theory.
        * Neural Contextual Bandits (Xu 2020): Leverage neural networks to learn complex relationships between context and actions.
        * Thompson Sampling: Probabilistic algorithm that balances exploration and exploitation.
* **Algorithm Adaptation:**
    * Adapt the chosen algorithm to work with the transformed feature vectors.
    * This might involve:
        * Adjusting the action selection mechanism to use similarity measures in the projected space.
        * Modifying the policy network architecture to handle the combined feature representations.
* **Training Procedure:**
    1.  **Initialization:** Initialize the policy network and any other relevant parameters.
    2.  **Interaction Loop:**
        * Observe the user context (cₜ).
        * Use the policy (π) to select a job action (aₜ) from the set of available jobs (A).
        * Recommend the selected job to the user.
        * Receive feedback from the user and calculate the reward (rₜ).
        * Update the policy (π) using the RL algorithm to maximize the expected cumulative reward.
    3.  **Evaluation:**
        * Evaluate the performance of the RL agent using appropriate metrics (e.g., click-through rate, application rate, user satisfaction).
        * Compare the performance with baseline recommendation methods.

**3.  Benefits of Integration**

* **Personalized Recommendations:** RL allows for personalized recommendations based on user feedback and context.
* **Efficient Exploration:** Contextual bandits enable efficient exploration of the job space to discover relevant opportunities.
* **Adaptive System:** The system adapts to changing user preferences and job market trends.
* **Improved Accuracy:** The combination of skill-focused embeddings and RL can lead to more accurate and relevant job recommendations.
