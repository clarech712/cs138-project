# Reinforcement Learning for Job Recommendation: A Skill-Based Approach

## Project Overview

This project applies reinforcement learning techniques to the challenge of job recommendation systems, with a particular focus on skill extraction and matching. It processes large-scale job posting datasets from multiple sources, extracts structured information about required skills and qualifications using large language models, and implements a contextual bandit approach to model the job recommendation problem.

The core innovation of this project lies in its formulation of job recommendation as a contextual bandit problem, where the system learns to balance exploration (suggesting diverse job opportunities) with exploitation (recommending jobs that closely match a user's profile) while continuously adapting based on user feedback. The implementation leverages advanced natural language processing techniques to create meaningful representations of both job postings and user profiles.

## Data Processing and Management

### Data Sources and Volume

The project ingests and processes three substantial datasets from Kaggle:
- **Google Jobs Search Results** (287MB, 61.3K entries)
- **LinkedIn Job Postings** (556MB, 124K entries)
- **Data Analyst Jobs** (7.57MB, 2,253 entries)

This large-scale data processing demonstrates the ability to handle real-world data volumes while maintaining efficient computation.

### MongoDB Integration

The project implements a sophisticated data management system using MongoDB, a NoSQL database chosen for its flexibility with semi-structured data:

- **Custom MongoDB Importer**: Developed a robust `MongoImporter` class that intelligently processes CSV files in chunks to handle large datasets efficiently, identifies relevant columns for job titles and descriptions, and inserts documents with a well-defined structure into the database.

- **Efficient Data Access**: Created a `JobIterator` class that provides batch-wise access to MongoDB documents, optimizing memory usage during processing.

- **Data Management Utilities**: Implemented utilities for database backup, document retrieval, and content updates.

The MongoDB document structure is carefully designed to support the project's analytical needs:

```json
{
    "doc_id": "unique_identifier",
    "source_file": "source_filename",
    "original_index": "index_from_source",
    "job_title": "job title",
    "description": "job description",
    "metadata": {
        // Additional fields from source data
    },
    "technical_skills": ["python", "sql", "tableau"],
    "soft_skills": ["communication", "teamwork"],
    "experience_requirements": ["3+ years experience", "Bachelor's degree"]
}
```

## AI-Powered Skill Extraction

One of the core technical contributions of this project is the implementation of an AI-powered skill extraction system:

### LLM Integration

The project integrates Google's Gemini and OpenAI models for advanced natural language understanding:

- **Model Manager**: Created a flexible `model_manager.py` module that provides a unified interface to different LLM services, handling API authentication and model selection.

- **Prompt Engineering**: Developed sophisticated prompts that guide the LLM to extract three distinct categories of information from job descriptions:
  - Technical skills (programming languages, tools, frameworks)
  - Soft skills (communication, teamwork, leadership)
  - Experience requirements (education, years of experience)

### Skill Extractor Implementation

The `SkillExtractor` class showcases advanced NLP application techniques:

- **Structured Data Extraction**: Processes unstructured job descriptions to extract structured data using carefully designed prompts.

- **Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling for API responses, including JSON parsing fallbacks.

- **Resume Fit Analysis**: Provides functionality to compare resumes against job descriptions, determining technical, soft skill, and experience matches.

## Feature Engineering and Transformation

The project demonstrates sophisticated feature engineering techniques for representing job postings and user profiles in a way that enables effective machine learning:

### Embedding Generation

- **Sentence Transformers**: Uses the `SentenceTransformer` library to create contextual embeddings of job titles and descriptions.

- **FastText Integration**: Implements FastText embeddings for skill representation, capturing semantic relationships between related skills.

- **Custom Embedding Pipeline**: The `FeatureTransformationPipeline` class orchestrates multiple embedding approaches:
  ```python
  def transform_skills_with_fasttext(self, skills_list: List[List[str]]) -> np.ndarray:
      skill_embeddings = []
      for skills in skills_list:
          if not skills:  # Handle empty skill lists
              embedding_dim = self.fasttext_model.get_dimension()
              skill_embeddings.append(np.zeros(embedding_dim))
              continue
          # Get embeddings for each skill and average them
          skill_vecs = [self.fasttext_model.get_word_vector(skill) for skill in skills]
          avg_embedding = np.mean(skill_vecs, axis=0)
          skill_embeddings.append(avg_embedding)
      return np.array(skill_embeddings)
  ```

### Feature Transformation

The project implements a sophisticated feature transformation pipeline inspired by the LinUCB paper:

1. **Projection**: Concatenates skill embeddings and applies dimensionality reduction to create compact representations.

2. **Optional Clustering**: Implements K-means clustering to group similar job descriptions, supporting both dimensionality reduction and recommendation diversity.

## Reinforcement Learning Formulation

The cornerstone of this project is its innovative reinforcement learning approach to job recommendation:

### Contextual Bandit Framework

The job recommendation problem is formulated as a contextual bandit problem with the following components:

- **Context (cₜ)**: The transformed feature vector of the user, including profile information, skills, experience, and preferences.

- **Action (aₜ)**: The transformed feature vector of a job posting, encoded to capture its skills requirements and descriptions.

- **Reward (rₜ)**: User feedback signals, including both explicit feedback (clicks, applications) and implicit feedback (time spent viewing).

- **Policy (π)**: A function that maps user contexts to job recommendations, optimized to maximize cumulative reward.

### RL Algorithm Implementation

The project explores multiple contextual bandit algorithms:

- **LinUCB**: Leverages linear models with upper confidence bound exploration.

- **Neural Contextual Bandits**: Uses neural networks to model complex context-action relationships.

- **Thompson Sampling**: Employs a Bayesian approach to balance exploration and exploitation.

### Training and Exploration-Exploitation Balance

The implementation carefully addresses the exploration-exploitation dilemma:

1. **Initialization**: Bootstrap the model with initial parameters.

2. **Interaction Loop**:
   - Observe user context
   - Select a job action using the policy
   - Recommend the job and collect feedback
   - Update the policy to maximize expected reward

3. **Adaptive Learning**: Continuously refine recommendations based on user interactions.
