###   Data Preprocessing and Feature Transformation (WIP)

**Objective:** To create robust and informative feature representations of job descriptions, focusing on hard skills, soft skills, and job requirements, and to prepare these representations for use in a recommendation system, potentially leveraging a contextual bandit approach.

**1.  Input Data**

* **Job Descriptions:** Raw textual data.
* **Hard Skills:**
    * A list of extracted hard skills (e.g., programming languages, software tools, technical skills).
    * Example: `["Python", "Java", "SQL", "TensorFlow", "Cloud Computing"]`
* **Soft Skills:**
    * A list of extracted soft skills (e.g., communication, teamwork, leadership).
    * Example: `["Communication", "Teamwork", "Leadership", "Problem-solving"]`
* **Job Requirements:**
    * A list or structured representation of job requirements.
    * Example: `["5+ years experience", "Bachelor's degree", "Master's preferred", "Remote work", "Project management experience"]`

**2.  Feature Encoding**

* **2.1   Hard Skill Embeddings**
    * **Method:**
        * FastText: Use FastText to generate embeddings for hard skills.
        * Rationale: FastText's subword information is valuable for handling variations in skill names (e.g., "Python" vs. "Python programming").
    * **Options:**
        * Pre-trained FastText embeddings (e.g., on a large corpus of code or technical documentation).
        * Train FastText embeddings on your job description corpus to make them more domain-specific.
    * **Output:**
        * A vector representation for each hard skill.
* **2.2   Soft Skill Embeddings**
    * **Method:**
        * BERT (or similar contextualized model): Use BERT to generate embeddings for soft skills within the context of the job description text.
        * Rationale: BERT captures the nuanced meaning of soft skills, which can vary depending on the context.
    * **Process:**
        * Extract sentences or phrases from the job description that mention soft skills.
        * Use BERT to embed these text snippets.
        * Aggregate the BERT embeddings (e.g., average pooling) to get a representation of each soft skill in the context of the job description.
    * **Output:**
        * A vector representation for each soft skill, contextualized by the job description.
* **2.3   Job Requirement Embeddings/Representation**
    * **Method:**
        * Option 1: BERT for Textual Requirements
            * If job requirements are primarily textual (e.g., "Experience with Agile methodologies"), use BERT to embed them.
        * Option 2: Structured Representation for Non-Textual Requirements
            * For requirements like "5+ years experience" or "Bachelor's degree," represent them as structured data (e.g., numerical values or categorical codes).
        * Option 3: Hybrid Approach
            * Combine BERT embeddings for textual requirements with structured representations for non-textual requirements.
    * **Output:**
        * A vector representation for textual job requirements and structured data for non-textual requirements.

**3.  Feature Transformation (Inspired by LinUCB)**

* **Rationale:**
    * To reduce dimensionality, capture relationships between features, and potentially improve the performance of the recommendation system.
    * Draws inspiration from the feature transformation techniques used in the LinUCB paper (See section 5.2.2 in paper) (though adapted to your specific data types).
* **Process:**
    * **3.1   Projection**
        * Concatenate the hard skill embeddings, soft skill embeddings, and job requirement representations for each job description.
        * Apply a linear projection layer (or a small neural network) to reduce the dimensionality of this combined feature vector.
        * This projection aims to:
            * Reduce noise and redundancy in the data.
            * Capture the most important relationships between skills and requirements.
            * Create a more compact representation for efficient processing.
    * **3.2   Clustering (Optional but Potentially Useful)**
        * Apply a clustering algorithm (e.g., k-means) to the projected feature vectors.
        * This would group job descriptions with similar skill and requirement profiles.
        * Rationale:
            * Can further reduce dimensionality by representing each job description with its cluster assignment.
            * May improve recommendation diversity by preventing the system from recommending too many similar jobs.
            * Can provide insights into job market trends and skill clusters.
* **Output:**
    * A transformed representation of each job description, suitable for use in a recommendation system (e.g., as the context for a contextual bandit algorithm or as input to a similarity matching model).
